# PeNSE 2012 & 2015 Analyses

PeNSE (Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde Escolar) is a ressearch from IBOPE (Instituto Brasileiro de Opinião Públia e Estatística) aim to understund the student's behavior, personal and 
social difficulties.
In my ressearch I've used the two more recent data: 2012 and 2015.
The database is too large, more than 25 MB, therefore a leave the link of the repository for dowload yourself...
